<h2>Divisibility</h2>

<definition>The <u>integers</u> are the counting numbers,  positive, negative and zero, i.e. 
\(\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\). We denote the set of integers by \(\mathbb{Z}\). We sometimes write 
\(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) for the set of integers greater than or equal to zero, etc.
</definition>

<definition> For integers \(a\) and \(b \neq 0\) we say that \(a\) is <u>divisible</u> by \(b\) (or that 
\(b\) <u>divides</u> \(a\)) if there is an integer \(c\) such that \(a = bc\). We write \(b \;|\; a\).
</definition>

<definition> For \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) we define \(|a|\) to be \(-a\) if \(a < 0\) and \(a\) if \(a \geq 0\). 
We call \(|a|\) the <u>absolute value</u> of \(a\). Note that for all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) we have \(|a| \geq 0\).
</definition> 

<definition> The <u>natural numbers</u> are the positive integers \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\). We denote the set of natural
numbers by \(\mathbb{N}\).
</definition> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(b \;|\; a\) then \(a \geq b\).
</theorem>

<proof> We have that \(a = bc\) for some natural number \(c\). If \(c = 1\) then \(a = b\). Otherwise \(c > 1\) 
and \(a = b + (c-1)b > b\), as \(c-1) \geq 0\). 
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(b \;|\; a\) and \(a \;|\; b\) then \(a = b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We see from the previous theorem that \(a \geq b\) and \(b \geq a\). Thus \(a = b\).
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a \;|\; b\) and \(b \;|\; c\) then \(a \;|\; c\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We can write \(b = ua\) and \(c = vb\) for some integers \(u, v\). But then \(c = vb = vua\), i.e. \(c\) 
is a multiple of \(a\). 
</proof> 

<theorem> (Division algorithm) If \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(b \neq 0\) then there exist 
\(q, r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) such that \(a = bq + r\), and \(0 \leq r < b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We let \(qb\) be the largest non-negative multiple of \(b\) which does not exceed \(a\). We then set 
\(r = a - bq\). Clearly \(r \geq 0\). But we also have \(r < b\). Otherwise, let \(r = b + r'\) for some 
\(r' \geq 0\). Then \(b + r' = a - bq\), i.e. \(r' = a - b(q + 1)\). But as \(r' \geq 0\) we have that \(b(q + 1)\) 
is a larger multiple of \(b\) not exceeding \(a\) than \(bq\), which is a contradiction. Thus \(r < b\) after all.
</proof> 

<h2>GCD and LCM</h2>

<definition> The <u>greatest common divisor</u> of two natural numbers \(b\) and \(c\), denoted \(\gcd(b, c)\) is the 
largest natural number which divides both \(b\) and \(c\). If \(\gcd(b, c) = 1\) we say that \(b\) and \(c\) are 
<u>coprime</u>. 

By convention we also define \(\gcd(b, 0) = b\), \(\gcd(0, c) = c\) and \(\gcd(0, 0) = 0\) for all 
\(b, c \in \mathbb{N}\).  
</definition> 

<definition> The <u>least common multiple</u> of two natural numbers \(b\) and \(c\), denoted \(\mbox{lcm}(b, c)\) is 
the smallest natural number which is divisible by both \(b\) and \(c\).
</definition> 

<theorem> If \(c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) then \(c\) divides any common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> Assume \(d\) is a common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(c\) does not divide \(d\). Then by the 
division algorithm, \(d = qc + r\) with \(0 \leq r < c\). As \(a\) and \(b\) both divide \(c\) and \(d\) we see that 
\(r\) is also a common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\). But as \(r < c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) we have a contradiction. Thus \(c\) 
must divide \(d\) after all.
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) then 
\[c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; a, b \;|\; ab/c \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; \mbox{lcm}(a, b) \;|\; ab/c 
\;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b).\]
</theorem> 

<proof> For the first implication, if \(c \;|\; a\) then \(a/c\) is a natural number, thus \(ab/c\) is a multiple of 
\(b\). Similarly if \(c \;|\; b\) then \(ab/c\) is a multiple of \(a\). Conversely, if \(a \;|\; ab/c\) then \(b/c\) 
is an integer. Similarly if \(b \;|\; ab/c\) then \(a/c\) is an integer. Thus \(c \;|\; a, b\). </br></br>

The second implication is given by the previous theorem. For the converse, as \(a, b \;|\; \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) by definition 
then \(a, b \;|\; ab/c\). </br></br>

For the third implication, we can write \(ab/c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)u\) for some natural number \(u\), i.e. 
\(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b) = cu\) which implies \(c\) divides \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). The converse follows by reversing 
the argument. </br></br>
</proof>

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) then 
\[ab = \gcd(a, b)\mbox{lcm}(a, b).\]
</theorem> 

<proof> By the previous theorem \(c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). 

If we set \(c = \gcd(a, b)\) then we have \(\gcd(a, b) \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) which implies
\(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b) \geq \gcd(a, b)\). 

On the othe hand, setting \(c = ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) we see that \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) is a common divisor of 
\(a\) and \(b\), which implies \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b) \leq \gcd(a, b)\) by definition of the greatest common divisor.

Combining the two inequalities we see that \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b) = \gcd(a, b)\).
</proof> 

<theorem> Any common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is a divisor of \(\gcd(a, b)\).
</theorem> 

<proof> From the previous two theorems we have respectively that 
\(c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) and \(\gcd(a, b) = ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). Combining 
these facts the result follows immediately.
</proof> 

<theorem> For \(b, c \in \mathbb{N}\) we have that 
\[\gcd(b, c) = \gcd(b, |b - c|).\]
</theorem> 

<proof> Let \(d = \gcd(b, c)\). As \(d\) divides \(b\) we can write \(b = sd\) for some natural number \(s\). Similarly 
we can write \(c = td\) for some natural number \(t\). Thus \(|b - c| = |sd - td| = |s - t|d\). Thus \(d\) divides 
\(|b - c|\). As we already have that \(d\) divides \(b\), the previous theorem says that \(d\) divides \(\gcd(b, |b - c|)\), 
i.e. \(\gcd(b, c)\) divides \(\gcd(b, |b - c|)\). </br></br>

Conversely, if \(g = \gcd(b, |b - c|)\) then we can write \(b = gu\) and \(|b - c| = gv\) for some integers \(u\) and 
\(v\). If \(b - c = 0\) then \(g = b\) and we see that \(g \;|\; \gcd(b, c)\). Otherwise \(u\) and \(v\) are natural 
numbers. But now \(c = b - (b - c) = gu \pm gv = g(u \pm v)\) and so \(g \;|\; c\). We already have that \(g \;|\; b\), 
thus by the previous theorem we have \(g \;|\; \gcd(b, c)\), i.e. \(\gcd(b, |b - c|)\) divides \(\gcd(b, c)\). </br></br>

But now \(d = \gcd(b, c)\) divides \(g = \gcd(b, |b - c|)\) and conversely, thus by an earlier theorem we have 
\(\gcd(b, c) = \gcd(b, |b - c|)\).
</proof> 

<theorem> For \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(b \neq 0\), if 
\[a = bq + r\] 
for \(q, r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(r < b\) then we have 
\[\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r).\]
</theorem>

<proof> Let \(g = \gcd(a, b)\) and \(d  = \gcd(b, r)\). As \(g\) divides \(a\) and \(b\), it also divides \(r = a - bq\).
Thus \(g\) divides both \(b\) and \(r\) and thus by a previous theorem it divides their gcd, \(d\). </br></br>

Again by definition \(d\) divides \(b\) and \(r\). Therefore it divides \(a = bq + r\). Thus \(d\) divides
both \(a\) and \(b\) and thus divides their gcd, \(g\). </br></br>

By a previous result, as \(d\) divides \(g\) and conversely, \(d = g\), which is what we wanted to show.
</proof>

<theorem> (Euclid's algorithm) Given \(a, \b \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(b \neq 0\), we can compute \(\gcd(a, b\)
in finitely many steps by repeated application of the previous theorem.
</theorem>

<proof> Write \(r_{-1} = a, r_0 = b\). Given \(r_{i-1}, r_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(r_i \neq 0\} we can use
the division algorithm to find \(q_{i+1}, r_{i+1}\) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0\} such that
\[r_{i-1} = q_{i+1}r_i + r_{i+1},\]
with \(r_{i+1} < r_i\). </br></br>

As the sequence \(r_{-1}, r_0, r_1, \ldots\) is stricly decreasing and starts at a finite value, and every \(r_i \geq 0\)
we must eventually reach \(0\). </br></br>

If \(r_k\) is the final nonzero remainder in the sequence then applying the previous theorem to each pair of consecutive
remainders in turn, we see that \(\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(r_k, 0) = r_k\). In other words, the last nonzero remainder in the
sequence is the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\). Thus we can compute \(\gcd(a, b\) in finitely many steps. </br></br>
</proof>

<theorem> (Extended euclidean algorithm) Given \(a, \b \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(b \neq 0\), if \(d = \gcd(a, b)\)
then we can find \(s, \t \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that
\[d = as + bt.\]
</theorem>

<proof> Let \(r_k\) be the last nonzero remainder in the sequence given by the euclidean algorithm, i.e. 
\(r_k = \gcd(a,b)\). Thus the final application of the division algorithm before we reached a nonzero remainder yielded
\[r_{k-2} = q_kr_{k-1} + r_k.\]

Rewriting this we have \(r_k = r_{k-2} - q_kr_{k-1}\). But the previous application of the division algorithm can also
be rewritten, giving \(r_{k-1}\) in terms of \(r_{k-2}\) and \(r_{k-3}\). Thus we can replace \(r_{k-1}\) in the
expression for \(r_k\) yielding an expression for \(r_k\) in terms of \(r_{k-2}\) and \(r_{k-3}\) only. </br></br>

Rewriting each of the equations from previous applications of the division algorithm in turn and substituting, we
eventually obtain an expression for \(r_k\) in terms of \(r_{-1}\) and \(r_0\) only, i.e. in terms of \(a\) and \(b\).
</br></br>

As \(r_k = \gcd(a, b)\) we have an expression of the form \(\gcd(a, b) = as + bt\) for some \(s, t \in \mathbb{Z}\).
</proof>
