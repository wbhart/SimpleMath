<h2>Divisibility rules</h2>

<theorem> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $2$ iff it ends in $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$ or $8$ when written in decimal.
</theorem>

<proof> A number $m$ that ends in the decimal digit $k$ is of the form $m \equiv k \pmod{10}$. By a previous 
theorem $m \equiv k \pmod{2}$. Thus $m$ is even iff $k \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$. The possibilities for $k$ are therefore
precisely the ones given.
</proof>

<theorem> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $5$ iff it ends in $0$ or $5$ when written in decimal.
</theorem>

<proof> If $k$ is the last digit, $m \equiv k \pmod{10}$. By a previous theorem $m \equiv k \pmod{5}$. Thus the 
possibilities for $k$ are $0$ or $5$.
</proof>

<corollary> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $10$ iff it ends in $0$ when written in decimal.
</corollary>

<theorem> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $3$ iff the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $3$.
</theorem>

<proof> A digit $k$ represents the value $k\times 10^n$ for some $n \geq 0$, depending on what place it is in. As 
$10 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, we have that $k\times 10^n \equiv k \pmod{3}$. Thus a number is congruent to the sum of its
digits modulo $3$.
</proof>

<corollary> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $9$ iff the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $9$.
</corollary>

<theorem> A natural number $m$ is divisible by $4$ iff its final two decimal digits give a number divisible by $4$.
</theorem>

<proof> As $100$ is divisible by $4$, only the last two digits are relevant.
</proof>

<theorem> A natural number $m = 10n + k$ is divisible by $7$ iff $n - 2k$ is divisible by $7$. To test division of a 
number by $7$, let $k$ be the final digit and $n$ the number formed by the remaining digits. Repeatedly apply the rule 
until a value between $-18$ and $0$ (inclusive) is obtained. If the remaining number is $-14$, $-7$ or $0$, the original
number was divisible by $7$. 
</theorem>

<proof> If $10n + k$ is divisible by $7$ then so is $-2(10n + k) = -20n - 2k$. But $-20n - 2k \equiv n - 2k \pmod{7}$.
</br></br>
  
If $m$ is positive, $n - 2k < 10n + k$. Thus, repeated application of the rule reduces the number whilst it remains
positive. On the first occasion that that the number becomes nonpositive, as $k$ can be at most $9$, $n - 2k \geq -18$.
Thus the final value must lie between $-18$ and $0$ inclusive. The only values in this range that are divisible by $7$
are those given.
</proof>

<theorem> To test whether a number is divisible by $8$, if the hundreds digit is even examine the number formed by the 
final two digits for divisibility by $8$. Otherwise, add $4$ to the number formed by the last two digits and examine for
divisibility by $8$.
</theorem>

<proof> As $1000$ is divisible by $8$, only the final three digits count. As $200$ is divisible by $8$ an even hundreds 
digit does not contribute. Otherwise, an odd hundreds digit contributes $100 \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$.
</proof>

<theorem> A number of the form $m = 100n + 10k_1 + k_2$ is divisible by $11$ iff $n - k_1 + k_2$ is. To test whether a
number is divisible by $11$ test the alternating sum of its digits by divisibility by $11$.
</theorem>

<proof> We have that $100n + 10k_1 + k_2 \equiv n - k_1 + k_2 \pmod{11}$. If $k_1, k_2$ are the final two digits of a
number, repeated application of the rule computes the alternating sum of the digits of a number (the leading digit may be
zero).
</proof>

<theorem> Suppose that $d \equiv 1, 3, 7, 9 \pmod{10}$. Let $k = 9, 3, 7, 1$ respectively. Let $m = (kd + 1)/10$. A 
number $n = 10a + b$ is divisible by $d$ iff $a + mb$ is.
</theorem>

<proof> In each case we have that $kd \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$. Thus $kd + 1$ is divisible by $10$ and $m$ is an integer.
</br></br>

If $n$ is divisible by $d$ then so is $nm = akd + a + mb$. This implies that $a + mb$ is. </br></br>

The converse holds by reversing the argument if we can show that $m$ and $d$ are coprime. But if $m$ and $d$ share a
factor bigger than $1$, so do $10m$ and $d$, i.e. $\gcd(kd + 1, d) \neq 1$. As this is not possible, we must have that
$m$ and $d$ are coprime.
</proof>

<h2>Factorials</h2>

<definition> The product of the first $n$ natural numbers is call $n$ <u>factorial</u>. It is denoted $n!$.
</definition>

<theorem> The product $P$ of two consecutive integers is divisible by $2! = 2$.
</theorem>

<proof> The product is of the form $P = n(n + 1)$ for some integer $n$. If $n$ is even then $n$ is divisible by $2$ and
therefore so is $P$. Otherwise $n$ is odd and $n + 1$ is even. In that case $P$ is also divisible by $2$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of three consecutive integers is divisible by $3! = 6$.
</theorem>

<proof> By the previous theorem, the product of the first two of the three integers is divisible by $2$. Thus the product
of all three consecutive integers $P = n(n + 1)(n + 2)$ is divisible by $2$. </br></br>

As every third integer is divisible by $3$ (starting at $0$ say), there are at most two integers in a row which are not
divisible by $3$. Therefore, given any three integers in a row, at least one of them must be divisible by $3$. Thus $P$
is also divisible by $3$. </br></br>

Thus $P$ is divisible by $\lcm(2, 3) = 6$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any four consecutive integers is divisible by $4! = 24$.
</theorem>

<proof> Every fourth integer is divisible by $4$ (starting at $0$). Thus, at most three consecutive integers are not
divisible by $4$. Therefore, at least one of the four consecutive integers is divisible by $4$. </br></br>

Of the remaining three integers, at least two are consecutive. Thus that pair is divisible by $2$. Therefore the product
of all four integers is divisible by $4\times 2 =8$. </br></br>

Furthermore, the product of the first three integers of the four is divisible by $3$. We therefore have that the product 
of all four integers is divisible by $\lcm(8, 3) = 24$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any five consecutive integers is divisible by $5! = 120$.
</theorem>

<proof> As every fifth integer is divisible by $5$, one of the five integers is divisible by $5$. By the previous theorem
the first four integers are divisible by $24$. Thus the product of all five is divisible by $\lcm(24, 5) = 120$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any six consecutive integers is divisibly by $6! = 720$.
</theorem>

<proof> By a previous result, the product of the first three integers are divisible by $6$. The product of the remaining 
three are also divisible by $6$. Thus the product of all six integers is divisible by $6 \times 6 = 36$. </br>

Also by a previous result, the first five integers are divisible by $120$. Therefore the product of all six numbers is
divisible by $\lcm(36, 120) = 720$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product of any $n$ consecutive integers is divisible by $n!$.
</theorem>

<proof> If one of the integers is $0$, the product is $0$ and therefore divisible by $n!$. </br></br>

Otherwise, the integers are all positive or all negative. In the latter case we have $\pm 1$ times the product of $n$ 
consecutive natural numbers. So it suffices to prove the result when the integers are all positive. </br></br>

Let $P_n(k) = (k + 1)(k + 2)\ldots (k + n)$. We have that $P_n(0) = n!$ and thus $P_n(0)$ is divisible by $n!$. We prove
the result we are after by induction on $n$ and $k$. We assume that it has been shown that $P_m(k)$ is divisible by $m!$
for all $1 \leq m < n$ and all $k \geq 0$. </br></br>

If also $P_n(r)$ is divisible by $n!$ for $0 \leq r \leq k$, then 
$$P_n(k + 1) = (k + 2)(k + 3) \ldots (k + n + 1)$$ $$= (k + 2)(k + 3) \ldots ((k + 1) + n) = P_n(k) + nP_{n-1}(k + 1).$$
By the induction hypothesis, the first term on the right is divisible by $n!$ and $P_{n-1}(k + 1)$ is divisible by 
$(n - 1)!$. Thus the second term on the right is divisible by $(n - 1)!n = n!$. Thus $P_n(k + 1)$ is divisible by $n!$.
</proof>
