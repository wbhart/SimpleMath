<h2>Divisibility</h2>

<definition>The <u>integers</u> are the counting numbers,  positive, negative and zero, i.e. 
\(\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\). We denote the set of integers by \(\mathbb{Z}\). We sometimes write 
\(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}_{< 0}\) for the set of integers greater than or equal to zero
or less than zero, respectively, and so on.
</definition>

<definition> For integers \(a\) and \(b \neq 0\) we say that \(a\) is <u>divisible</u> by \(b\) (or that 
\(b\) <u>divides</u> \(a\)) if there is an integer \(c\) such that \(a = bc\). We write \(b \;|\; a\)
</definition>

<definition> For \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) we define \(|a|\) to be \(-a\) if \(a < 0\) and to be \(a\) otherwise. 
We call \(|a|\) the <u>absolute value</u> of \(a\). Note that for all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\) we have \(|a| \geq 0\).
</definition> 

<definition> The <u>natural numbers</u> are the positive integers \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\). We denote the set of natural
numbers by \(\mathbb{N}\).
</definition> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(b \;|\; a\) then \(a \geq b\).
</theorem>

<proof> We have that \(a = bc\) for some natural number \(c\). If \(c = 1\) then \(a = b\). Otherwise \(c > 1\) 
and \(a = b + (c-1)b > b\). 
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(b \;|\; a\) and \(a \;|\; b\) then \(a = b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We see from the previous theorem that \(a \geq b\) and \(b \geq a\). Thus \(a = b\).
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a \;|\; b\) and \(b \;|\; c\) then \(a \;|\; c\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We can write \(b = ua\) and \(c = vb\) for some integers \(u, v\). But then \(c = vb = vua\), i.e. \(c\) 
is a multiple of \(a\). 
</proof> 

<theorem> (Division algorithm) If \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) with \(b \neq 0\) then there exist 
\(q, r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\) such that \(a = bq + r\), and \(0 \leq r < b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> We let \(qb\) be the largest non-negative multiple of \(b\) which does not exceed \(a\). We then set 
\(r = a - bq\). Clearly \(r \geq 0\). But we also have \(r < b\). Otherwise, let \(r = b + r'\) for some 
\(r' \geq 0\). Then \(b + r' = a - bq\), i.e. \(r' = a - b(q + 1)\). But as \(r' \geq 0\) we have that \(b(q + 1)\) 
is a larger multiple of \(b\) not exceeding \(a\) than \(bq\), which is a contradiction. Thus \(r < b\) after all.
</proof> 

<h2>GCD and LCM</h2>

<definition> The <u>greatest common divisor</u> of two natural numbers \(b\) and \(c\), denoted \(\gcd(b, c)\) is the 
largest natural number which divides both \(b\) and \(c\). If \(\gcd(b, c) = 1\) we say that \(b\) and \(c\) are 
<u>coprime</u>. 

By convention we also define \(\gcd(b, 0) = b\), \(\gcd(0, c) = c\) and \(\gcd(0, 0) = 0\) for all 
\(b, c \in \mathbb{N}\).  
</definition> 

<definition> The <u>least common multiple</u> of two natural numbers \(b\) and \(c\), denoted \(\mbox{lcm}(b, c)\) is 
the smallest natural number which is divisible by both \(b\) and \(c\).
</definition> 

<theorem> If \(c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) then \(c\) divides any common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\).
</theorem> 

<proof> Assume \(d\) is a common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(c\) does not divide \(d\). Then by the 
division algorithm, \(d = qc + r\) with \(0 \leq r < c\). As \(a\) and \(b\) both divide \(c\) and \(d\) we see that 
\(r\) is also a common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\). But as \(r < c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) we have a contradiction. Thus \(c\) 
must divide \(d\) after all.
</proof> 

<theorem> If \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) then 
\[ab = \gcd(a, b)\mbox{lcm}(a, b).\]
</theorem> 

<proof> We first show that 
\[c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; a, b \;|\; ab/c \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; \mbox{lcm}(a, b) \;|\; ab/c 
\;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b).\]

For the first implication, if \(c \;|\; a\) then \(a/c\) is a natural number, thus \(ab/c\) is a multiple of \(b\). 
Similarly \(ab/c\) is a multiple of \(a\). Conversely, if \(a \;|\; ab/c\) then \(b/c\) is an integer. Similarly 
\(a/c\) is an integer. Thus \(c \;|\; a, b\). </br></br>

The second implication is given by the previous theorem. For the converse, as \(a, b \;|\; \mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) by definition 
then \(a, b \;|\; ab/c\). </br></br>

For the third implication, we can write \(ab/c = \mbox{lcm}(a, b)u\) for some natural number \(u\), i.e. 
\(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b) = cu\) which implies \(c\) divides \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). The converse follows by reversing 
the argument. </br></br>

We have shown \(c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). If we set \(c = \gcd(a, b)\) then we 
have \(\gcd(a, b) \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). Setting \(c = ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) we see that \(ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\) 
is a common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\). Thus it must be the greatest common divisor.
</proof> 

<theorem> <reference id="divgcd"></reference> Any common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is a divisor of \(\gcd(a, b)\).
</theorem> 

<proof> In the proof of the previous theorem we showed that \(c \;|\; a, b \;\;\mbox{iff}\;\; c \;|\; ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). But 
we also showed \(\gcd(a, b) = ab/\mbox{lcm}(a, b)\). Combining these facts the result follows immediately.
</proof> 

<theorem> For \(b, c \in \mathbb{N}\) we have that 
\[\gcd(b, c) = \gcd(b, |b - c|).\]
</theorem> 

<proof> Let \(d = \gcd(b, c)\). As \(d\) divides \(b\) we can write \(b = sd\) for some natural number \(s\). Similarly 
we can write \(c = td\) for some natural number \(t\). Thus \(|b - c| = |sd - td| = |s - t|d\). Thus \(d\) divides 
\(|b - c|\). As we already have that \(d\) divides \(b\), the previous theorem says that \(d\) divides \(\gcd(b, b - c)\), 
i.e. \(\gcd(b, c)\) divides \(\gcd(b, b - c)\). </br></br>

Conversely, if \(g = \gcd(b, b - c)\) then we can write \(b = gu\) and \(|b - c| = gv\) for some integers \(u\) and 
\(v\). If \(b - c = 0\) then \(g = b\) and we see that \(g \;|\; \gcd(b, c)\). Otherwise \(u\) and \(v\) are natural 
numbers. But now \(c = b - (b - c) = gu \pm gv = g(u \pm v)\) and so \(g \;|\; c\). We already have that \(g \;|\; b\), 
thus by Theorem <script>document.write(window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById("divgcd"),':before').getPropertyValue("content"));</script> we have that \(g \;|\; \gcd(b, c)\), i.e. \(\gcd(b, |b - c|)\) divides \(\gcd(b, c)\). 
</br></br>

But now \(d = \gcd(b, c)\) divides \(g = \gcd(b, |b - c|)\) and conversely, thus by an earlier theorem we have 
\(\gcd(b, c) = \gcd(b, |b - c|)\).
</proof>
