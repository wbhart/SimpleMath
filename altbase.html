<h2>Numbers to an alternative base</h2>

<definition> A natural number $n$ is said to be written in <u>base</u> $b$ if it is expressed
$$n = a_0 + a_1b + a_2b^2 + \cdots + a_mb^m,$$
where $0 \leq a_i < b$ for all $i$ and $a_m \neq 0$.
</definition>

<theorem> If $b > 1$, every natural number $n$ can be expressed uniquely in base $b$.
</theorem>

<proof> We show by induction that every $0 < n < b^{m + 1}$ can be written in base $b$ in $\leq m + 1$ digits. For $m = 1$ 
this says every $0 < n < b$ can be expressed in one digit, which follows since every $0 < b_0 < n$ is admitted. </br></br>

Assume the result is true for $0 < n < b^m$. Let $b^m \leq n < b^{m + 1}$. Let $n \equiv a_0 \pmod{b}$ for some
$0 \leq a_0 < b$. Write $n' = (n - b_0)/b$. As $n - b_0$ is divisible by $b$ we have that $n'$ is an integer. Moreover
$b^{m - 1} \leq n' < b^m$. Thus $n'$ can be written in base $b$ as $n' = a_1 + a_2b + \cdots + a_mb^{m - 1}$ for integers 
$0 \leq a_i < b$. Thus $n = a_0 + b(a_1 + a_2b + \cdots + a_mb^{m - 1}) = a_0 + a_1b + \cdots + a_mb^m.$ </br></br>

If $n = a_0 + a_1b + \cdots + a_mb^m = c_0 + c_1b + \cdots + c_nb^n$ are two representations of $n$ then $n \equiv a_0$ and
$n \equiv c_0 \pmod{b}$. As $0 \leq a_0, c_0 < b$ then $a_0 = c_0$. Subtracting $a_0$ from $n$ and dividing by $b$ we have
$a_1 + \cdots + a_mb^m = c_1 + \cdots + c_nb^n$. Repeating the argument, we see both representations have the same digits.
Thus the representations are the same, i.e. the representation of $n$ in base $b$ is unique.
</proof>

<definition> A <u>rational</u> number is a number which can be written $a/b$ for some integers $a, b$ with $b \neq 0$. We
say that a fraction $a/b$ is <u>proper</u> if $b > 0$ and $0 \leq a < b$. A fraction $a/b$ is in <u>lowest terms</u> if
$\gcd(a, b) = 1$.
</definition>

<theorem> In base $b$ a rational number $m$ can be expressed 
$$m = b^na_n + \cdots + ba_1 + a_0 + b^{-1}a_{-1} + b^{-2}a_{-2} + \cdots,$$
for some digits $0 \leq a_i < b$ and $b_n \neq 0$. 
</theorem>

<proof> If $m = c/d$ for some positive integer $d$ we can write $m = r + s/d$ for some $0 \leq s < d$. The radix 
representation of $r$ gives the digits of $m$ before the radix point. We then have $0 \leq s/d < 1$. </br></br>

Write $s_0 = s$. We have $0 \leq bs_0/d < b$. Thus we can write $bs_0/d = a_{-1} + s_{-1}/d$ for some 
$0 \leq s_{-1} < d$. Repeating the argument we compute successive digits $a_{-1}, a_{-2}, \ldots$ of $s/d$. By 
construction $s/d = b^{-1}a_{-1} + b^{-2}a_{-2} + \cdots$. 
</proof>

<definition> If $m$ is a rational number, we usually write the value
$$m = b^na_n + \cdots + ba_1 + a_0 + b^{-1}a_{-1} + b^{-2}a_{-2} + \cdots,$$
by juxtaposing the digits
$$m = a_n \ldots a_1 a_0 . a_{-1} a_{-2}\ldots,$$ 
where the point after the the digit $a_0$ is referred to as the <u>radix point</u> (<u>decimal point</u> if the base 
$b = 10$). We call this <u>radix representation.</u>
</definition>

<theorem> The radix representation of rational numbers is not unique.
</theorem>

<proof> We will show that if $s = (b-1)b^{-1} + (b-1)b^{-2} + \cdots$ then $s = 1$. </br></br>

Note that $bs = (b - 1) + (b-1)b^{-1} + (b-1)b^{-2} + \cdots = b - 1 + s$. Thus $(b - 1)s = (b - 1)$. As $b > 1$ we have
that $s = 1$.
</proof>

<definition> A radix representation which repeats the same sequence of digits over and over, forever, is said to be
<u>recurring</u>. If the representation consists entirely of the repeating digits, the representation is said to be
<u>purely recurring</u>. If the representation is purely recurring with the exception of finitely many digits, it is said
to be <u>eventually recurring</u>.
</definition>

<theorem> A number of the form $s/(b^n - 1)$ for $s < b^n - 1$ is purely recurring.
</theorem>

<proof> Let $u = b^{-n} + b^{-2n} + \cdots$. We have that $(b^n - 1)u = (u + 1) - u = 1$. Thus $u$ gives the radix 
representation of $1/(b^n - 1)$. If $s < b^n - 1$, it has $n$ digits and so $su = s/(b^n - 1)$ has a purely recurring 
representation. 
</proof>

<theorem> The radix representation of a rational number $c/d$ in base $b$ is eventually recurring.
</theorem>

<proof> We note $c/d$ can be written $r + s/d$ for $0 \leq s < d$. The value $r$ only affects the part of the radix 
representation before the radix point and so can be ignored. It thus suffices to restrict to the case $c < d$. </br></br>

The number $c/d$ has an eventually recurring representation iff $b^kc/d$ with $k \geq 0$ does, since multiplying by $b^k$
simply shifts the digits. But we can find a $k$ such that $b^kc/d$ written in lowest terms has $\gcd(b, d) = 1$. We will
show that $b^kc/d$ can be written in the form $a/(b^n - 1)$ and is thus eventually recurring. </br></br>

Consider the values $b^n - 1 \pmod{d}$, for $n \geq 1$. As $d$ is finite, there exist values $n_0 < n_1$ such that
$b^{n_0} \equiv b^{n_1} \pmod{d}$. As $\gcd(b, d) = 1$ we can divide through by $b^{n_0}$. Thus 
$b^{n_1 - n_0} = 1 \pmod{d}$. But this means that $d$ divides $b^{n_1 - n_0} - 1$, i.e. $b^n - 1 = vd$ for some $v$, 
where $n = n_1 - n_0$. But then $b^kc/d = b^kcv/(b^n - 1)$.
</proof>
