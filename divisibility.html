<h2>Divisibility</h2>

<definition>The <u>integers</u> are the counting numbers,  positive, negative and zero, i.e. 
$\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. We denote the set of integers by $\Z$. We sometimes write 
$\Z_{\geq 0}$ for the set of integers greater than or equal to zero, etc.
</definition>

<definition> For integers $a$ and $b$ we say that $a$ is <u>divisible</u> by $b$ (or that 
$b$ <u>divides</u> $a$ or $a$ is a <u>multiple</u> of $b$) if there is an integer $c$ 
such that $a = bc$. We write $b \;|\; a$.
</definition>

<definition> For $a \in \Z$ we define $|a|$ to be $-a$ if $a < 0$ and $a$ if $a \geq 0$. 
We call $|a|$ the <u>absolute value</u> of $a$. Note that for all $a \in \Z$ we have $|a| \geq 0$.
</definition> 

<definition> The <u>natural numbers</u> are the positive integers $1, 2, 3, \ldots$. We denote the set of natural
numbers by $\N$.
</definition> 

<definition> If $a, b \in \N$ we say $b$ is a <u>factor</u> of $a$ if $b$ divides $a$.
</definition>

<definition> We say that a divisor of a natural number $n$ is <u>proper</u> if it is not equal to $n$.
</definition>

<theorem> For $a, b \in \Z$ with $b \neq 0$, $a/b = c$ for some $c \in \Z$ iff $b \;|\; a$.
</theorem>

<proof> If $a/b = c$ then $a = bc$ and $a$ is divisible by $b$. Conversely if $b \;|\; a$ then $a = bc$ for some 
$c \in \Z$. As $b \neq 0$ dividing through by $b$ gives $a/b = c$.
</proof>

<theorem> If $a, b \in \N$ and $b \;|\; a$ then $a \geq b$.
</theorem>

<proof> We have that $a = bc$ for some natural number $c$. If $c = 1$ then $a = b$. Otherwise $c > 1$ 
and $a = b + (c-1)b > b$, as $c-1) \geq 0$. 
</proof> 

<theorem> If $a, b \in \N$ and $b \;|\; a$ and $a \;|\; b$ then $a = b$.
</theorem> 

<proof> We see from the previous theorem that $a \geq b$ and $b \geq a$. Thus $a = b$.
</proof> 

<theorem> If $a \;|\; b$ and $b \;|\; c$ then $a \;|\; c$.
</theorem> 

<proof> We can write $b = ua$ and $c = vb$ for some integers $u, v$. But then $c = vb = vua$, i.e. $c$ 
is a multiple of $a$. 
</proof> 

<theorem> If $a, b, n \in \Z$ and $n$ divides $a$ and $b$ then $n$ divides $as + bt$ for all integers
$s$ and $t$.
</theorem>

<proof> By assumption there exist $c, d \in \Z$ such that $a = cn$ and $b = dn$. Thus 
$as + bt = cns + dnt = n(cs + dt).$ In other words $as + bt$ is divisible by $n$.
</proof>

<corollary> If $a, b, n \in \Z$ and $n$ divides $a$ and $b$ then $n$ divides $a + b$ and $a - b$. If $n$ divides $a$ then
$n$ divides $sa$ for all $s \in \Z$.
</corollary>

<theorem> If $a, b, c \in \Z$ with $c \neq 0$ then $ac \;|\; bc$ iff $a \;|\; b$.
</theorem>

<proof> If $ac \;|\; bc$ then there exists $d \in \Z$ such that $acd = bc$. As $c \neq 0$ we can divide through
by $c$, which gives $ad = b$, i.e. $a \;|\; b$. Conversely, if $a \;|\; b$ then there exists $d \in \Z$ such that
$ad = b$. Multiplying through by $c$ we get $acd = bc$ which implies $ac \;|\; bc$.
</proof>

<theorem> (Division algorithm) If $a \in \Z$ and $b \in \N$ then there exist 
$q, r \in \Z$ such that $a = bq + r$, and $0 \leq r < b$.
</theorem> 

<proof> Consider the set of all integers of the form $a - bq$ for $q \in \Z$. We see that it is always possible to find
values of $q$ such that $a - bq \geq 0$ (if $a \geq 0$ just pick $q = 0$. If $a < 0$ pick $q < 0$ sufficiently small).
Thus the set of integers $a - bq > 0$ is non-empty. 
</br></br>

This set of integers must have a least value for some $q$. For this $q$ we claim $0 \leq a - bq < b$. We have 
$0 \leq a - bq$ by definition. Also, $a - bq < b$, otherwise $0 \leq a - b(q + 1)$ which is a lesser number of the
required form. </br></br>

We set $r = a - bq$ to be this least nonnegative value. Thus $0 \leq r < b$.
</proof> 

<definition> Given $a \in \Z$ and $b \in \N$ and $q, r$ as given by the division algorithm, we call $q$ the
<u>quotient</u> of $a$ by $b$ and $r$ the (least non-negative) <u>remainder</u>.
</definition>

<theorem> If $a \in \Z$ and $b \in \N$ then there exist 
$q, r \in \Z$ such that $a = bq + r$, and $-b/2 < r \leq b/2$.
</theorem>

<proof> We take $r'$ to be the least non-negative remainder, and $q'$ the associated quotient. If $r' > b/2$ we set
$r = r' - b$ and $q = q' + 1$, otherwise we take $r = r'$ and $q = q'$. </br></br> 

In the first case $0 = b - b > r = r' - b > b/2 - b = -b/2$ and $bq + r = b(q' + 1) + r' - b = bq' + r' = a$. </br></br> 

In the second case $0 \leq r = r' \leq b/2$ and $bq + r = bq' + r' = a$.
</proof>

<definition> We call $r'$ in the previous theorem the <u>least absolute remainder</u>.
</definition>
