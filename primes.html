<h2>Primes</h2>

<definition> A natural number $n > 1$ is said to be <u>prime</u> if it is divisible only by $1$ and $n$. A natural number
which is divisible by a number other than $1$ and itself is said to be <u>composite</u>.
</definition>

<theorem> Every natural number $n$ greater than $1$ is divisible by a prime number.
</theorem>

<proof> If $n$ is a prime then we are done. Otherwise $n$ is composite and has at least one factor $a_1$ other than $1$ 
or $n$. Note that $a_1 < n$. </br></br>

Again if $a_1$ is prime then we are done. Otherwise $a_1$ is composite and has a factor $a_2$ other than $1$ or $a_1$ 
with $a_2 < a_1$. We keep applying the same argument and construct a sequence of natural numbers 
$n > a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > \cdots$ with $a_{i+1} \;|\; a_i$ for each $i$ and $a_1 \;|\; n$. But this sequence cannot go on
forever as it is strictly decreasing. Eventually it must stop at a number which has no factors other that $1$ and
itself, i.e. at a prime $a_m$. </br></br>

But $a_m$ divides $a_{m-1}$ and $a_{m-1}$ divides $a_{m-2}$, thus $a_m$ divides $a_{m-2}$. Repeating this argument we see
that $a_m$ divides each of $a_{m-1}, a_{m-2}, \ldots, a_1, n$. Thus $n$ is divisible by the prime number $a_m$.
</proof>

<theorem> Every natural number $n > 1$ can be written as a product of prime numbers.
</theorem>

<proof> If $n$ is prime we are done. Otherwise by the previous theorem we can write $n = p_1n_1$ for some prime number 
$p_1$. Note that $n_1 < n$. Now we apply the same argument to $n_1$ and so on. We construct a sequence of prime numbers
$p_1, p_2, \ldots$ and numbers $n > n_1 > n_2 > \cdots$. </br></br>

Eventually this process must terminate as the sequence of natural numbers $n_i$ is strictly decreasing. We must reach
some $n_m$ which is itself a prime $q$. In so doing we will have written $n = p_1p_2\cdots p_mq$ where each of the $p_i$
and $q$ are prime.
</proof>

<theorem> There are infinitely many prime numbers.
</theorem>

<proof> Let us assume there are finitely many prime numbers, $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Consider the number 
$N = p_1p_2\cdots p_n + 1$. Clearly $N > 1$. Also, $N > p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. </br></br>

Now $N$ is divisible by a prime $q$ say. But $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. For if it is
divisible by $p_i$ say, then $1 = N - p_1p_2\cdots p_n$ is also divisible by $p_i$, which is impossible. Therefore, $q$
is a prime distinct from all of those in the finite list $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. This is a contradiction and so there
must be an infinite number of primes.
</proof>

<definition> A natural number is said to be <u>even</u> if it is divisible by $2$, otherwise it is <u>odd</u>.
</definition>

<theorem> The only even prime is $2$.
</theorem>

<proof> Clearly $2$ is prime since the only natural number less than it is $1$. Thus its only factors are $1$ and $2$.
Every even number is of the form $n = 2m$ for some natural number $m$ by definition. The number $2$ is the case $m = 1$. 
In every other case $n$ is composite since $2 \;|\; n$ and $2 \neq n$ and $2 \neq 1$.
</proof>

<theorem> If $n = ab \in \N$ for $a, b \neq 1$ then either $a \leq \sqrt{n}$ or $b \leq \sqrt{n}$.
</theorem>

<proof> If $a, b \neq 1$ then $1 < a, b < n$. If both are greater than $\sqrt{n}$ their product is greater than $n$. 
Thus one of them must be at most $\sqrt{n}$.
</proof>

<theorem> If $n > 1$ is a natural number which is not divisible by any prime $p \leq \sqrt{n}$, then $n$ is prime.
</theorem>

<proof> Let $p$ be the smallest prime dividing $n$. Write $n = pm$. If $m = 1$ then then $n$ is prime and the only prime
dividing $n$ is $n$ itself, which is greater than $\sqrt{n}$. </br></br>

On the other hand if $m > 1$ it can be written as a product of primes, all of which are at least $p$ by definition.
Thus $m \geq p$. Thus $n \geq p^2$, i.e. $p \leq \sqrt{n}$. In other words, if $n$ is composite, the smallest prime
dividing $n$ is at most $\sqrt{n}$. </br></br>

Therefore, if $n$ is not divisible by any primes $p \leq \sqrt{n}$ it is itself prime.
</proof>

<example> The first few prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$.
</example>

<proof> We know $2$ is prime. For each of the other numbers $n$ in the list we must show that they are not divisible by any
primes up to $\sqrt{n}$. For each of $3, 5, 7$ it is sufficient that they are not divisible by $2$. For the remaining
numbers it is sufficient that they are not divisible by $2$ or $3$. 
</proof>

<theorem> There are infinitely many primes of the form $4k + 3$.
</theorem>

<proof> Note that $3$ is a prime of this form. Now suppose that there are only finitely many primes of this form, 
$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Consider the number $N = 4p_1p_2\cdots p_n - 1$. As $N$ is larger than each of the $p_i$ it
cannot be prime. </br></br>

Write $N$ as a product of primes $N = q_1q_2\cdots q_m$. As $N$ is odd, it is not divisible by $2$. Thus each of the 
$q_i$ are odd, i.e. of the form $2s + 1$ for some $s$. If $q_i = 2s + 1$ and $s$ is even, i.e. $s = 2k$ for some $k$ then 
$q_i = 4k + 1$. When $s$ is odd, i.e. $s = 2k + 1$ for some $k$ then $q_i = 4k + 3$. </br></br>

But not all of the $q_i$ can be of the form $4k + 1$, since a product of numbers of this form is also of this form. For,
$(4k_1 + 1)(4k_2 + 1) = 4(4k_1k_2 + k_1 + k_2) + 1$. But $N$ is not of this form. Therefore at least one of the prime
factors $q_i$ of $N$ is of the form $4k + 3$. But $q_i$ cannot be equal to any of the $p_i$, otherwise $q_i$ divides
$1 = 4p_1p_2\cdots p_n - N$. This is a contradiction and therefore there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k + 3$.
</proof>

<theorem> There are infinitely many primes of the form $6k + 5$.
</theorem>

<proof> The prime $5$ is of this form. Suppose there are finitely many primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of this form.
Consider the number $N = 6p_1p_2\cdots p_n - 1$. As $N > p_i$ for each $i$ it is not prime. </br></br>

Write $N = q_1q_2\ldots q_m$ with $q_i$ prime for all $i$. Each $q_i$ must be of the form $6k$, $6k + 1$, $6k + 2$, 
$6k + 3$, $6k + 4$ or $6k + 5$ by the division algorithm. But no $q_i$ can be of the form $6k$, $6k + 2$ or $6k + 4$ as
all of these are divisible by $2$ and $N$ is odd. Similarly no $q_i$ can be of the form $6k + 3$ since this is divisible
by $3$ and $N$ is not. Thus each of the $q_i$ must be of the form $6k + 1$ or $6k + 5$. </br></br>

But not all of the $q_i$ can be of the form $6k + 1$ since any product of numbers of this form is also of this form 
($(6k_1 + 1)(6k_2 + 1) = 6(6k_1k_2 + k_1 + k_2) + 1$), but $N$ is not of this form. Thus at least one of the $q_i$ is of 
the form $6k + 5$. However, $q_i$ cannot be any of the $p_i$ since otherwise $q_i$ divides $1 = 6p_1p_2\cdots p_n - N$,
which is impossible. Thus we have a contradiction and there are infinitely many primes of the form $6k + 5$.
</proof>

<corollary> There are infinitely many primes of the form $3k + 2$.
</corollary>

<theorem> If a prime $p$ divides a product $ab$ of natural numbers then either it divides $a$ or it divides $b$ (or 
both).
</theorem>

<proof> We show that if $p$ divides $ab$ but does not divide $a$ then it divides $b$. </br></br>

As $p$ does not divide $a$ then $p$ and $a$ are coprime, as the only divisors of $p$ are $1$ and $p$. Therefore, by the
extended euclidean algorithm we can find $s, t \in \Z$ such that $ps + at = 1$. Multiplying through by $b$ we have
$pbs + abt = b$. But now $p$ divides $b = pbs + abt$.
</proof>

<theorem> (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic) Every natural number $n > 1$ can be written as a product of primes in only
one way, up to the order of the factors.
</theorem>

<proof> Suppose to the contrary that $n \in \N$ is written as a product of primes in two essentially different ways, 
$n = p_1p_2\cdots p_r = q_1q_2\cdots q_s$, for $p_i$ and $q_j$ prime. </br></br>

We see that $p_1 \;|\; n$. Therefore by the previous theorem it divides either $q_1$ or $q_2q_3\cdots q_s$. If the latter
then it either divides $q_2$ or $q_3q_4\cdots q_s$, etc. Thus we see that $p_1$ divides one of the $q_j$. </br></br>

But if one prime divides another, they are the same prime since the only factor of a prime other than $1$ is the prime
itself. Therefore $p_1$ is equal to one of the $q_j$. By renumbering we can assume that it is equal to $q_1$. We can
therefore divide $p_1 = q_1$ from both sides. </br></br>

We repeat the argument in turn with $p_2$, $p_3$ up to $p_r$. Eventually we divide by all the primes $p_i$, which leaves
$1$. Each of the $p_i$ will have been equal to one of the $q_j$ in some order. Thus the primes were the same after all.
</proof>

<definition> We say that a proper divisor $a$ of a natural number $n$ is <u>maximal</u> if no other proper divisor of 
$n$ contains $a$ as a factor. The quotient $n/a$ of a maximal divisor $a$ of $n$ is called the <u>index</u> of $a$ in 
$n$.
</definition>

<definition> Let $n$ be a natural number. If $a_1$ is a maximal divisor of $n$ and $a_2$ a maximal divisor of $a_1$, and
$a_3$ a maximal divisor or $a_2$, etc., we call the sequence $a_0 = n, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ a <u>composition series</u>.
</definition>

<theorem> Given a natural number $n$, the index of a maximal divisor $d$ of $n$ in $n$ must be a prime divisor of $n$. 
</theorem>

<proof> Suppose to the contrary that $n/d = ab$ for $a, b \neq 1$. Then $n = abd$ and $bd$ is a proper divisor of $n$ 
containing $d$ as a proper factor. This contradicts the maximality of $d$. Thus $n/d$ must be prime. </br></br>

Furthemore, if $p$ is the index $n/d$ then $n = pd$, i.e. $p$ is one of the prime divisors of $n$. 
</proof>

<theorem> (Jordan) Let $a_0 = n, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ be a composition series of a natural number $n$. The set of indices
$a_0/a_1, a_1/a_2, \ldots$ is unique up to order.
</theorem>

<proof> Note that as $n$ is finite and we keep taking proper divisors, the composition series must be finite, i.e. 
$a_m = 1$ for some $m$. </br></br>

Let $p_1$ be the index of a maximal divisor $a_1$ of $a_0$. Then $a_0 = p_1a_1$. Similarly, if $p_2$ is the index of a
maximal divisor $a_2$ of $a_1$ then $a_1 = p_2a_2$. Then $a_0 = p_1p_2a_2$, etc. Eventually the composition series
terminates and by the previous theorem we will have expressed $n = a_0$ as a product of primes $p_1p_2\cdots p_m$. As the
prime factorisation of $n$ is unique up to order, and the $p_i$ are indices of the composition series, this set of 
indices is also unique up to order.
</proof>
