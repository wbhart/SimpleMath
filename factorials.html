<h2>Factorials</h2>

<definition> The product of the first $n$ natural numbers is call $n$ <u>factorial</u>. It is denoted $n!$.
</definition>

<theorem> The product $P$ of two consecutive integers is divisible by $2! = 2$.
</theorem>

<proof> The product is of the form $P = n(n + 1)$ for some integer $n$. If $n$ is even then $n$ is divisible by $2$ and
therefore so is $P$. Otherwise $n$ is odd and $n + 1$ is even. In that case $P$ is also divisible by $2$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of three consecutive integers is divisible by $3! = 6$.
</theorem>

<proof> By the previous theorem, the product of the first two of the three integers is divisible by $2$. Thus the product
of all three consecutive integers $P = n(n + 1)(n + 2)$ is divisible by $2$. </br></br>

As every third integer is divisible by $3$ (starting at $0$ say), there are at most two integers in a row which are not
divisible by $3$. Therefore, given any three integers in a row, at least one of them must be divisible by $3$. Thus $P$
is also divisible by $3$. </br></br>

Thus $P$ is divisible by $\lcm(2, 3) = 6$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any four consecutive integers is divisible by $4! = 24$.
</theorem>

<proof> Every fourth integer is divisible by $4$ (starting at $0$). Thus, at most three consecutive integers are not
divisible by $4$. Therefore, at least one of the four consecutive integers is divisible by $4$. </br></br>

Of the remaining three integers, at least two are consecutive. Thus that pair is divisible by $2$. Therefore the product
of all four integers is divisible by $4\times 2 =8$. </br></br>

Furthermore, the product of the first three integers of the four is divisible by $3$. We therefore have that the product 
of all four integers is divisible by $\lcm(8, 3) = 24$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any five consecutive integers is divisible by $5! = 120$.
</theorem>

<proof> As every fifth integer is divisible by $5$, one of the five integers is divisible by $5$. By the previous theorem
the first four integers are divisible by $24$. Thus the product of all five is divisible by $\lcm(24, 5) = 120$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product $P$ of any six consecutive integers is divisibly by $6! = 720$.
</theorem>

<proof> By a previous result, the product of the first three integers are divisible by $6$. The product of the remaining 
three are also divisible by $6$. Thus the product of all six integers is divisible by $6 \times 6 = 36$. </br>

Also by a previous result, the first five integers are divisible by $120$. Therefore the product of all six numbers is
divisible by $\lcm(36, 120) = 720$.
</proof>

<theorem> The product of any $n$ consecutive integers is divisible by $n!$.
</theorem>

<proof> If one of the integers is $0$, the product is $0$ and therefore divisible by $n!$. </br></br>

Otherwise, the integers are all positive or all negative. In the latter case we have $\pm 1$ times the product of $n$ 
consecutive natural numbers. So it suffices to prove the result when the integers are all positive. </br></br>

Let $P_n(k) = (k + 1)(k + 2)\ldots (k + n)$. We have that $P_n(0) = n!$ and thus $P_n(0)$ is divisible by $n!$. We prove
the result we are after by induction on $n$ and $k$. We assume that it has been shown that $P_m(k)$ is divisible by $m!$
for all $1 \leq m < n$ and all $k \geq 0$. </br></br>

If also $P_n(r)$ is divisible by $n!$ for $0 \leq r \leq k$, then 
$$P_n(k + 1) = (k + 2)(k + 3) \ldots (k + n + 1)$$ $$= (k + 2)(k + 3) \ldots ((k + 1) + n) = P_n(k) + nP_{n-1}(k + 1).$$
By the induction hypothesis, the first term on the right is divisible by $n!$ and $P_{n-1}(k + 1)$ is divisible by 
$(n - 1)!$. Thus the second term on the right is divisible by $(n - 1)!n = n!$. Thus $P_n(k + 1)$ is divisible by $n!$.
</proof>

<definition> Given a real number $r$, the largest integer less than or equal to $r$ is called the <u>floor</u> of $r$. We
write $\lfloor r \rfloor$ for the floor of $r$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $r$ is called the 
<u>ceiling</u> of $r$, denoted $\lceil r \rceil$.</definition>

<theorem> Let $p$ be a prime. The highest power of $p$ dividing $n!$ for $n$ a natural number is $p^\alpha$ where
$$\alpha = \lfloor \frac{n}{p} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \rfloor + \cdots,$$
where the sum is continued to the largest power of $p$ less than or equal to $n$.
</theorem>

<proof> Each multiple of $p$ in the factors $1, 2, \ldots n$ of the factorial contributes at least one multiple of $p$
to the power $p^\alpha$. There are precisely $\lfloor n/p \rfloor$ such multiples of $p$. </br></br>

Each multiple of $p^2$ contributes at least $p^2$ to the power $p^\alpha$, and there are precisely 
$\lfloor n/p^2 \rfloor$ multiples of $p$ amongst $1, 2, \ldots, n$. Since we already counted all the multiples of $p$,
the multiples of $p^2$ contribute a further factor of $p$ each to $p^\alpha$. </br></br>

Similarly, each multiple of $p^3$ contributes $p^3$ to $p^\alpha$. There are $\lfloor n/p^3 \rfloor$ multiples of $p^3$,
but we already counted all multiples of $p^2$, so each multiple of $p^3$ contributes only another factor of $p$ to 
$p^\alpha$. </br></br>

The process terminates when we reach powers of $p$ that are already bigger than $n$. At this point there are no further
contributions to $p^\alpha$. Therefore the sum is as given.
</proof>

<definition> Suppose that a natural number $n$ is written in base $p$, for a prime $p$,
$$n = a_0 + a_1p + a_2p^2 + \cdots + a_mp^m.$$
We will denote the sum of the digits $a_i$ by $\sigma_p(n)$, i.e. $\sigma_p(n) = \sum_{i=0}^m a_i$.
</definition>

<theorem> Let $p$ be a prime. The highest power of $p$ dividing a natural number $n$ is given by $p^\alpha$ where
$$\alpha = \frac{n - \sigma_p(n)}{p - 1}.$$
</theorem>

<proof> From the expression for $n$ in base $p$ we see that
$$a_i = \lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \rfloor - p\lfloor \frac{n}{p^{i + 1}} \rfloor.$$

Summing this expression over $i$ we find
$$\sigma_p(n) = \lfloor \frac{n}{p^0} \rfloor - (p - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^m \lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \rfloor 
= n - (p - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^m \lfloor \frac{n}{p^i}.$$

Rearranging this equation and applying the previous theorem gives the result we are after.
</proof>
