<h2>Binomial Coefficients</h2>

<definition> The integer coefficients of $(x + y)^n$ are called the <u>binomial coefficients</u>. We denote the coefficient
of $x^{n - i}y^i$ by $\binom{n}{i}$.
</definition>

<theorem> For $0 \leq i \leq n$ we have
$$\binom{n}{i} = \binom{n}{n - i}.$$
</theorem>

<proof> We have $(x + y)^n = (y + x)^n$. But the coefficient of $x^{n - i}y^i$ is $\binom{n}{i}$ on the left and 
$\binom{n}{n - i}$ on the right.
</proof>

<theorem> The binomial coefficients are characterised by
<ul>
<li> For all $n \geq 0$, $\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1$</li>
<li> For $n > 1$ and $0 < i < n$, $\binom{n}{i} = \binom{n - 1}{i - 1} + \binom{n - 1}{i}$.</li>
</ul>
</theorem>

<proof> For $n = 0$ the only binomial coefficient is $\binom{0}{0}$. It corresponds to the single coefficient in 
$(x + y)^0$, which is $1$. </br></br>

For all $n$ we have that $\binom{n}{0}$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(x + y)^n$, i.e. $1$. By the previous theorem we 
also have $\binom{n}{n} = 1$. All other binomial coefficients are of the form $\binom{n}{i}$ for $n > 1$ and $0 < i < n$.
The theorem defines these inductively in terms of binomial coefficients of the form $\binom{n - 1}{j}$. Thus it suffices 
to show that the second relation of the theorem actually holds for binomial coefficients. </br></br>

We have that $(x + y)^n = (x + y)^{n-1}(x + y)$. The $x^{n - i}y^i$ term is $x$ times the term 
$\binom{n - 1}{i}x^{n - i - 1}y^i$ plus $y$ times the term $\binom{n - 1}{i - 1}x^{n - i}y^{i - 1}$. Thus, $\binom{n}{i}$,
the coefficient of $x^{n - i}{y^i}$ is $\binom{n - 1}{i} + \binom{n - 1}{i - 1}$.
</proof>

<theorem> For $n \geq 0$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$ we have that 
$$\binom{n}{i} = \frac{n!}{(n - i)!i!}.$$
</theorem>

<proof> It suffices to show that the value in the theorem satisfies the conditions of the previous theorem since these
completely characterise the binomial coefficients.</br></br>

Let us write $C(n, i) = \frac{n!}{(n - i)!i!}$. We have that for all $n$, $C(n, 0) = \frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1$. Similarly,
$C(n, n) = \frac{n!}{0!n!} = 1$. </br></br>

Finally 
$$C(n - 1, i - 1) + C(n - 1, i) = \frac{(n - 1)!}{(n - i)!(i - 1)!} + \frac{(n - 1)!}{(n - i - 1)!i!}$$
$$= \frac{(n - 1)!(i + (n - i))}{(n - i)!i!} = \frac{n!}{(n - i)!i!} = C(n, i).$$
Thus we must have $C(n, i) = \binom{n}{i}$.
</proof>
