<h2>Binomial Coefficients</h2>

<definition> The integer coefficients of $(x + y)^n$ are called the <u>binomial coefficients</u>. We denote the coefficient
of $x^{n - i}y^i$ by $\binom{n}{i}$.
</definition>

<theorem> For $0 \leq i \leq n$ we have
$$\binom{n}{i} = \binom{n}{n - i}.$$
</theorem>

<proof> We have $(x + y)^n = (y + x)^n$. But the coefficient of $x^{n - i}y^i$ is $\binom{n}{i}$ on the left and 
$\binom{n}{n - i}$ on the right.
</proof>
